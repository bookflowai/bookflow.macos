# BookFlowAI - AI-Powered Language Learning from PDFs

Welcome to **BookFlowAI**, a macOS application designed to revolutionize language learning by leveraging AI to analyze PDF books. This project uses the power of the Gemini API to split PDFs into chapters, generate teacher-style summaries, and create exercises, making it easier for users to learn any language from their favorite books. Built by an indie iOS developer with a passion for language learning, this app is still a work in progress â€” join the journey!

## Overview

BookFlowAI allows you to:
- Upload any PDF book.
- Automatically split it into chapters or parts based on AI analysis.
- Generate concise summaries and tailored exercises for each chapter using the Gemini AI model.
- Visualize pages as thumbnails and interact with the content seamlessly.

This project is part of a broader vision to create a community-driven language learning tool.

## Features

- **PDF Parsing**: Loads and splits PDF documents into manageable parts or chapters.
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: Uses the Gemini API to detect chapter structures, create summaries, and generate exercises.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays page thumbnails and allows chapter selection for detailed analysis.
- **Customizable**: Supports user-uploaded PDFs and adjusts to their structure (with or without a table of contents).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on latest versions).
- Xcode (for building the app).
- A Gemini API key from Google (required for AI functionality).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BookFlowAI.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd BookFlowAI
   open BookFlowAI.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Add your Gemini API key:
   - Open `PDFLoaderViewModel.swift`.
   - Replace the empty apiKey string with your Gemini API key:
   ```swift
   private let apiKey: String = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

4. Build and run the project in Xcode.

## Usage

1. Launch the app.
2. Click the "Open PDF" button to select a PDF file.
3. Wait for the AI to analyze the document and split it into chapters.
4. Select a chapter to view its summary and exercises generated by Gemini.

## Project Status

- **Current State**: Work in progress (WIP). The core functionality (PDF splitting, AI analysis) works, but the UI and output quality need refinement.
- **Known Issues**: Summaries and exercises may be imperfect; design is basic.
- **Future Plans**: Improve UI, enhance AI accuracy, and integrate community feedback via the upcoming BookFlowAI Coin.

## Contributing

I'm a solo dev grinding after my 9-5 job, so any help is welcome! Feel free to:
- Open issues for bugs or suggestions.
- Submit pull requests with improvements (e.g., UI enhancements, better error handling).
- Support the project by joining the community on X.

## Support the Project

This app is my passion project to help myself and others learn languages (starting with my struggle with Spanish!). To keep it growing:
- Donate SOL to my wallet: `5cumoZBh4g5arW5x5i5fioFkfFWPA8GxHwZsX6AwRyQH`.
- Stay tuned for the BookFlowAI Coin launch on Pump.fun, which will fund further development and give holders a voice in the app's future.
